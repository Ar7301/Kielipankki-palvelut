# The commandline tools of the Language Bank

This set of Ansible roles installs all relevant command line tools to either CSC's HPC environment or virtual machines

## Getting Started

Use ansible-playbook myllyPouta.yml to create VM on Pouta and install hfst on it. (still work in progress)

Use ansible-playbook -i test site.yml to create a test installation to taito-login4.csc.fi:/tmp/<username>/ansible.
Note that this will only compile, not set paths.

### Prerequisites

So far some roles only work on Taito and assume gcc/python environments on Taito.
Modulefiles need to be updated manually.

## Deployment

ansible-playbook -i production site.yml

will install everything to Taito.
